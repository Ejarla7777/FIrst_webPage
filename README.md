# FIrst_webPage
This project aims to design and develop a responsive landing page for "The Blue Black Team" using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript. The page should showcase the team's mission, projects, and encourage user engagement through a modern, minimalist design. Key sections include a hero, about, projects, team, and contact information.
